# newKingOfHonor
This is final project
Name：李辰韬 Number：1909853D-I011-0201

This is the source code of the final report, the language is Java. 
I uploaded my own code from elsewhere and uploaded it myself to my github library. 
This program is a simple implementation of the King of Glory game. 
Certainly not as good as the real King of Glory. 
After modifying the code and adding comments, the final total LOC for the project is 2267 with 2 packets and 20 classes.
